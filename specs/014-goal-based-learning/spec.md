# Feature Specification: Memoryloop v2 - Goal-Based Learning Platform

**Feature Branch**: `014-goal-based-learning`
**Created**: 2025-12-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Transform Memoryloop from a chat-based flashcard generator into a goal-based learning platform with AI-generated skill trees and mastery tracking.

## Overview

Memoryloop v2 represents a fundamental pivot from a freeform chat interface to a structured, goal-based learning experience. Users define what they want to learn, the system generates a hierarchical skill tree, and users progress through topics with spaced repetition and mastery tracking.

**Target Users**: Professionals learning new skills (tech, marketing, creative fields)

**Key Differentiator**: Unlike ChatGPT (no study system) or Anki (no AI, poor UX), Memoryloop generates structured learning paths AND helps users retain knowledge through engaging study experiences.

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Create Learning Goal with Skill Tree (Priority: P1)

A professional wants to learn a new skill. They enter their learning goal, and the system generates a structured skill tree breaking down the topic into learnable chunks.

**Why this priority**: This is the core entry point that replaces the chat interface. Without this, users cannot begin their learning journey.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a goal "Learn Kubernetes" and verifying a hierarchical tree of topics is generated and displayed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a logged-in user on the home page, **When** they enter "Kubernetes administration" as a learning goal, **Then** the system generates a skill tree with categories (Core Concepts, Networking, Storage, Security) and subtopics under each.
2. **Given** a generated skill tree, **When** the user views it, **Then** they can see the hierarchical structure with checkboxes to select/deselect topics.
3. **Given** a skill tree with topics, **When** the user deselects "Security (Advanced)", **Then** that branch is excluded from their learning path.
4. **Given** a confirmed skill tree, **When** the user saves it, **Then** a new Learning Goal is created and appears in their dashboard.

### User Story 2 - Generate Cards for Skill Tree Node (Priority: P1)

A user wants to create study materials for a specific topic in their skill tree. They select a node and generate flashcards or quiz questions scoped to that topic.

**Why this priority**: Card generation is the core content creation mechanism. Without this, users have nothing to study.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by selecting a skill node "Pods" and generating 10 flashcards, then verifying they appear in the deck.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a skill tree with node "Pods" selected, **When** the user clicks "Generate Cards", **Then** the system generates flashcards specific to Kubernetes Pods.
2. **Given** generated cards, **When** the user views them, **Then** they can edit, delete, or approve each card before adding to their deck.
3. **Given** a set of approved cards, **When** the user confirms, **Then** cards are added to the deck and linked to the skill node for mastery tracking.
4. **Given** poor quality cards, **When** the user types refinement feedback "Make these more practical with real commands", **Then** the system regenerates improved cards.

### User Story 3 - Study with Multiple Modes (Priority: P1)

A user wants to study their cards using different formats to reinforce learning. They can choose flashcard mode, multiple choice, timed challenges, or mixed mode.

**Why this priority**: Multiple study modes increase engagement and retention. This differentiates from basic flashcard apps.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by starting a study session and switching between flashcard, multiple choice, and timed modes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a deck with 20 cards, **When** the user selects "Flashcard Mode", **Then** they see cards one at a time with flip-to-reveal interaction.
2. **Given** a deck with cards, **When** the user selects "Multiple Choice Mode", **Then** each card is presented as a question with 4 answer options.
3. **Given** a study session, **When** the user selects "Timed Challenge", **Then** they have a countdown timer and earn points for speed and accuracy.
4. **Given** any study mode, **When** the user rates their recall, **Then** the FSRS algorithm updates the card's next review date.

---

### User Story 4 - View Mastery Dashboard (Priority: P2)

A user wants to see their learning progress across all goals and topics. They view a dashboard showing mastery levels, upcoming reviews, and time invested.

**Why this priority**: Progress visibility motivates continued learning. Important but not blocking for core study functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by studying cards for a week and verifying the dashboard shows accurate mastery percentages.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user with an active learning goal, **When** they view the dashboard, **Then** they see their skill tree with mastery percentages per node (0-100%).
2. **Given** cards due for review, **When** the user views the dashboard, **Then** they see "12 cards due today, 24 due this week".
3. **Given** study history, **When** the user views metrics, **Then** they see total time invested and retention rate.
4. **Given** mastery milestones reached, **When** viewing progress, **Then** they see earned titles ("Kubernetes Apprentice") and achievements.

---

### User Story 5 - Earn Achievements and Titles (Priority: P3)

A user wants recognition for their learning milestones. They earn titles and achievements based on mastery, not arbitrary streaks or daily requirements.

**Why this priority**: Gamification increases engagement but is not essential for core learning functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by mastering 50 cards and verifying an achievement is unlocked.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user who masters their first 10 cards, **When** they check achievements, **Then** they see "First Steps" achievement unlocked.
2. **Given** 50% mastery of a learning goal, **When** viewing their profile, **Then** they see a title upgrade (e.g., "Apprentice" to "Practitioner").
3. **Given** a user who studies 7 days in a row, **When** they check achievements, **Then** they see "Perfect Week" (retroactive, not streak-based).
4. **Given** any achievement unlock, **When** it triggers, **Then** a celebratory animation plays (confetti, etc.).

---

### User Story 6 - Track Popular Topics for Curated Trees (Priority: P3)

The system tracks what topics users are learning to prioritize creating curated, domain-specific skill trees mapped to real-world standards.

**Why this priority**: Analytics-driven feature that improves long-term content quality but does not affect individual user experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by having 10 users create "AWS" goals and verifying analytics show AWS as a high-demand topic.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple users creating learning goals, **When** analyzing patterns, **Then** the system normalizes and counts topic frequency.
2. **Given** a topic with 50+ users, **When** an admin reviews analytics, **Then** they see it flagged for curated tree creation.
3. **Given** a curated tree exists for a topic, **When** a user creates a goal for that topic, **Then** they can choose between AI-generated or curated tree.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the LLM generates a skill tree that is too shallow or too deep? User can request regeneration with "more detail" or "simpler breakdown".
- What happens when card generation produces low-quality content? User can reject and request regeneration with specific feedback.
- What happens when a user has no cards due for review? Dashboard shows "All caught up!" with option to study ahead or generate new content.
- What happens when a user abandons a learning goal? Goals can be paused or archived, with data retained for potential resumption.
- What happens when the same topic is learned by multiple users? Each user gets their own skill tree instance but analytics track aggregate demand.

- LanceDB will continue to be used for vector search (semantic card search)
- PostgreSQL will store relational data (goals, trees, nodes, analytics)

## Out of Scope (Post-MVP)

- Domain-specific curated skill trees (start with AI-generated only)
- Leaderboards or competitive features
- Social features (sharing goals, studying with friends)
- Mobile-native apps (web-responsive only for MVP)
- Importing existing Anki decks
- API key integration for premium LLM quality
