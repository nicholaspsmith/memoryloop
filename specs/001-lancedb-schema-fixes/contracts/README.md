# API Contracts

This feature is an internal refactoring that does not modify public APIs or expose new endpoints.

**No external contracts defined.**

All changes are isolated to internal database initialization logic in:

- `lib/db/client.ts` (internal module)
- `lib/db/schema.ts` (internal module)

These modules are not exposed as public APIs.
