# Feature Specification: MemoryLoop - Claude-Powered Flashcard Learning Platform

**Feature Branch**: `001-claude-flashcard`
**Created**: 2025-12-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a web application (React, TypeScript, Next.js) that will allow me to generate flash cards derived from responses I receive from Claude LLM. The application will be hosted on https://memoryloop.nicholaspsmith.com. When a user opens that url in a browser, the app will check if the user is authenticated. If not, it will show a login screen. If logged in, user will see a 2-tabbed layout. The first tab will be a chat interface where a user can interact with Claude. In this custom chat interface, the user can generate flash cards from responses received from Claude. To do so, they will click a button on the chat interface. When this button is clicked, Claude will break down the content into individual question/answer combos and create a flash card where question is shown on one side, answer on the other. The user can then "quiz" themselves using their generated flashcards. The "quiz" feature will be contained in the second tab of the application."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - User Authentication (Priority: P1)

A user visits memoryloop.nicholaspsmith.com and needs to access their account to use the flashcard application. The system verifies their identity and grants or denies access based on valid credentials.

**Why this priority**: Authentication is the foundational security layer. Without it, no other features can function securely. This is the entry point to the entire application and must work before any learning activities can occur.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to access the application URL, verifying the login screen appears for unauthenticated users, submitting valid/invalid credentials, and confirming appropriate access is granted or denied. Delivers secure access control.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is not logged in, **When** they navigate to https://memoryloop.nicholaspsmith.com, **Then** they see a login screen
2. **Given** a user enters valid credentials on the login screen, **When** they submit the login form, **Then** they are authenticated and redirected to the main application interface
3. **Given** a user enters invalid credentials, **When** they submit the login form, **Then** they see an error message and remain on the login screen
4. **Given** a user is already authenticated, **When** they navigate to https://memoryloop.nicholaspsmith.com, **Then** they bypass the login screen and see the main application interface

### User Story 2 - Claude Chat Interaction (Priority: P2)

An authenticated user wants to have a conversation with Claude to learn about a topic. They access the chat interface, send messages to Claude, and receive informative responses that can later be converted into flashcards.

**Why this priority**: This is the core content generation mechanism. Users need to interact with Claude to create the source material for flashcards. Without this, there's no content to study from.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in, accessing the chat tab, sending various messages to Claude, receiving responses, and verifying the conversation history is displayed correctly. Delivers an interactive learning conversation tool.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user is on the application, **When** they view the interface, **Then** they see a 2-tab layout with the first tab labeled for chat
2. **Given** a user is on the chat tab, **When** they view the interface, **Then** they see a chat input area and a conversation display area
3. **Given** a user types a message in the chat input, **When** they submit the message, **Then** the message appears in the conversation history and Claude generates a response
4. **Given** Claude has generated a response, **When** the response is received, **Then** it is displayed in the conversation history below the user's message
5. **Given** a user has an ongoing conversation, **When** they send a new message, **Then** the conversation context is maintained and Claude responds appropriately to the full conversation history
6. **Given** a user has multiple messages in the conversation, **When** they scroll through the chat, **Then** all previous messages and responses are visible in chronological order

### User Story 3 - Flashcard Generation from Chat (Priority: P3)

A user has received helpful information from Claude and wants to convert it into flashcards for later study. They click a button on a Claude response, and the system automatically extracts key concepts and creates question-answer flashcard pairs.

**Why this priority**: This bridges the gap between learning through conversation and active recall practice. It enables users to transform passive reading into active study materials without manual effort.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having a conversation with Claude, clicking the flashcard generation button on a response, verifying that multiple flashcards are created with questions and answers, and confirming they are saved for later review. Delivers automated study material creation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Claude response is displayed in the chat, **When** the user views the response, **Then** a "Generate Flashcards" button is visible near the response
2. **Given** a user clicks the "Generate Flashcards" button on a response, **When** the action is processed, **Then** Claude analyzes the response content and generates multiple question-answer pairs
3. **Given** flashcards are being generated, **When** the process completes, **Then** the user sees a confirmation that flashcards were created and the number of flashcards generated
4. **Given** flashcards have been generated from a response, **When** the user views that response again, **Then** there is a visual indicator showing flashcards were already created from this content
5. **Given** a response contains minimal or no educational content, **When** the user tries to generate flashcards, **Then** the system provides feedback that insufficient content is available for flashcard creation

---

### User Story 4 - Flashcard Quiz Practice (Priority: P4)

A user wants to test their knowledge by reviewing previously generated flashcards. They access the quiz tab, see flashcards presented one at a time with the question visible, attempt to recall the answer, then reveal and check their understanding.

**Why this priority**: This completes the learning loop by enabling active recall practice, which is the most effective study method. Users can now benefit from spaced repetition and self-testing with the materials they've created.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to the quiz tab, starting a quiz session, viewing flashcard questions, revealing answers, progressing through multiple cards, and completing a study session. Delivers an interactive study and self-assessment tool.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user has generated flashcards, **When** they click the second tab (quiz tab), **Then** they see their collection of flashcards ready for practice
2. **Given** a user is on the quiz tab with available flashcards, **When** they start a quiz session, **Then** they see the first flashcard with only the question visible
3. **Given** a user sees a flashcard question, **When** they click to reveal the answer, **Then** the answer side of the flashcard is displayed
4. **Given** a user has revealed a flashcard answer, **When** they indicate they're ready to continue, **Then** the next flashcard question is presented
5. **Given** a user is reviewing flashcards, **When** they progress through the deck, **Then** they can track their position (e.g., "Card 3 of 15")
6. **Given** a user completes all flashcards in a session, **When** the last card is reviewed, **Then** they see a completion message and options to restart or exit the quiz
7. **Given** a user has no flashcards generated yet, **When** they access the quiz tab, **Then** they see a message prompting them to generate flashcards from the chat first

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user generates flashcards from a very long Claude response (e.g., 5000+ words)?
- What happens when a Claude response contains only conversational content with no factual information suitable for flashcards?
- What happens when a user tries to generate flashcards while offline or when the Claude API is unavailable?
- What happens when a user has generated hundreds of flashcards - how are they organized in the quiz tab?
- What happens when a user's authentication session expires while they're in the middle of a chat conversation or quiz session?
- What happens when concurrent users generate flashcards from the same conversation - are flashcards user-specific?
- What happens when a user clicks the flashcard generation button multiple times quickly on the same response?
- What happens when a user closes the browser in the middle of a conversation or quiz session?
