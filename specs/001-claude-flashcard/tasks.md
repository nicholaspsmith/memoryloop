# Tasks: MemoryLoop - Claude-Powered Flashcard Learning Platform

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-claude-flashcard/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Tests MUST be written before implementation per constitution (TDD). Each user story includes contract tests and integration tests.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- Next.js 15 App Router: `app/`, `components/`, `lib/`, `types/`, `tests/`
- Configuration files at repository root
- LanceDB data storage in `data/lancedb/`

---

- [ ] T028 [P] Create global CSS in app/globals.css (Tailwind imports, base styles)
- [ ] T029 [P] Create loading component in app/loading.tsx (global loading state)
- [ ] T030 [P] Create error component in app/error.tsx (global error boundary)
- [ ] T031 Create route groups in app/(auth)/ and app/(protected)/ (directory structure)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - User Authentication (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Authenticated users can sign up, log in, log out, and access protected routes. Unauthenticated users see login screen.

**Independent Test**: Navigate to app URL → see login screen → sign up with email/password → automatically logged in and redirected to chat → log out → redirected to login screen → log in with credentials → access chat interface.

**Maps to**: FR-001, FR-002, FR-003, FR-022

### Tests for User Story 1 (TDD - Write FIRST) ⚠️

> **NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**

- [ ] T032 [P] [US1] Contract test for POST /api/auth/signin in tests/contract/auth.test.ts

- [ ] T048 [US1] Add session expiration handling per FR-022 in middleware.ts
- [ ] T049 [US1] Create protected layout in app/(protected)/layout.tsx (auth guard, redirect to login)
- [ ] T050 [US1] Create home redirect in app/page.tsx (redirect authenticated users to /chat per FR-003)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently. Users can sign up, log in, log out, and access control works.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Claude Chat Interaction (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Authenticated users can have conversations with Claude, send messages, receive responses, and see complete conversation history in chronological order.

**Independent Test**: Log in → access chat tab → send message "What is spaced repetition?" → receive Claude response → send follow-up "Can you elaborate?" → Claude responds with context from previous message → scroll to see all messages in chronological order → reload page → conversation history persists (FR-023).

**Maps to**: FR-004, FR-005, FR-006, FR-007, FR-023

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently. Users can authenticate and have persistent conversations with Claude.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Flashcard Generation from Chat (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Users can click "Generate Flashcards" button on Claude responses to automatically create question-answer flashcard pairs. System prevents duplicates and provides feedback during generation.

**Independent Test**: Log in → send message to Claude → receive response → click "Generate Flashcards" button → see loading feedback → flashcards created → confirmation shows count → button changes to "Flashcards Generated" (duplicate prevention per FR-017) → click again → see "already generated" message.

**Maps to**: FR-008, FR-009, FR-010, FR-016, FR-017, FR-018, FR-019, FR-024

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Flashcard Quiz Practice (Priority: P4)

**Goal**: Users can review flashcards in quiz tab using FSRS spaced repetition. Cards shown one at a time with question visible, answer hidden until revealed. After rating (Again/Hard/Good/Easy), FSRS updates next review date.

**Independent Test**: Log in → click Quiz tab → see flashcard with question only → click "Show Answer" → answer revealed → click rating button (Good) → next card appears → see progress "Card 2 of 10" (FR-020) → complete all cards → see completion message (FR-021) → reload → due cards updated based on FSRS schedule.

**Maps to**: FR-011, FR-012, FR-013, FR-014, FR-015, FR-020, FR-021

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3 → P4)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1 for authentication, but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US2 for messages, but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US3 for flashcards, but independently testable

**Note**: While US2 depends on US1, US3 on US2, and US4 on US3 for full functionality, each story should have independent test scenarios that validate its core capabilities.

### Within Each User Story

1. Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD)
2. Contract tests before API routes
3. Component tests before components
4. Unit tests before utilities/services
5. Database operations before API routes
6. Components before pages
7. Core implementation before integration
8. Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

**Setup (Phase 1)**:

- T002-T004 (dependencies installation)
- T006-T008 (configuration files)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Authentication)

```bash
# Launch all contract tests for User Story 1 together (TDD - write first):
Task T032: "Contract test for POST /api/auth/signin"
Task T033: "Contract test for POST /api/auth/signup"
Task T034: "Contract test for POST /api/auth/signout"
Task T035: "Contract test for GET /api/auth/session"

# After tests written and failing, launch component tests in parallel:
Task T037: "Component test for LoginForm"
Task T038: "Component test for SignupForm"

# After all tests failing, implement auth forms in parallel:
Task T043: "Create LoginForm component"
Task T044: "Create SignupForm component"

# Implement auth pages in parallel:
Task T045: "Create login page"
Task T046: "Create signup page"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T012)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T013-T031) - CRITICAL - blocks all stories
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T032-T050)
   - Write tests first (T032-T038)
   - Ensure tests fail
   - Implement features (T039-T050)
   - Verify tests pass
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo authentication-only MVP if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Authentication MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Add Chat capability)
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Add Flashcard generation)
5. Add User Story 4 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Add Quiz with FSRS)
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T031)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (T032-T050) - Authentication
   - **Developer B**: User Story 2 (T051-T076) - Chat (waits for US1 auth)
   - **Developer C**: User Story 3 (T077-T098) - Flashcards (waits for US2 messages)
   - **Developer D**: User Story 4 (T099-T123) - Quiz (waits for US3 flashcards)
3. Stories complete and integrate sequentially due to dependencies, but can be developed in parallel once dependencies are met

**Recommended**: Sequential delivery (P1 → P2 → P3 → P4) for this project due to functional dependencies between stories.

---

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 146

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: 12 tasks
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: 19 tasks
- **User Story 1 - Authentication (P1)**: 19 tasks (7 tests + 12 implementation)

- **User Story 4 - Quiz (P4)**: 25 tasks (9 tests + 16 implementation)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: 23 tasks (includes offline mode and navigation component)

**Parallel Opportunities**: 67 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phases

**Independent Test Criteria**:

- **US1**: Can authenticate, sign up, log in, log out, and access control works
- **US2**: Can have persistent conversations with Claude maintaining context
- **US3**: Can generate flashcards from Claude responses with duplicate prevention

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies within phase
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story has independent test criteria
- TDD REQUIRED: Write tests first, ensure they fail, then implement
- Commit after each task or logical group following rules in .claude/rules.md for commit messages
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Constitution compliance: Documentation-first ✅, TDD ✅, Modular ✅, Simple ✅, Observable ✅
