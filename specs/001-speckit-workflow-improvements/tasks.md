# Tasks: Spec-Kit Workflow Improvements

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-speckit-workflow-improvements/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in the specification, but User Story 7 requires test creation for Phase 2 script enhancements.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story. Note: Phase 1 (User Stories 1-3) is already complete per PR 171.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

This feature works with bash scripts and command infrastructure:

- Scripts: `.specify/scripts/bash/`
- Commands: `.claude/commands/`
- Tests: `tests/bash/`
- Templates: `.specify/templates/`

---

## Phase 1: User Stories 1-3 (Priority: P1) ✅ COMPLETE

**Status**: ✅ Already implemented and merged via PR 171

User Stories 1-3 cover:

- US1: Agent Context Package Version Syncing
- US2: Feature-Specific Context Discovery
- US3: Multi-Agent Support Removal

**Implementation**: The `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh` script was refactored from 799 lines to ~160 lines, removing multi-agent support and focusing on package version synchronization from package.json to CLAUDE.md.

**No tasks required** - This phase is complete and merged to main.

---

## Phase 2: User Story 4 - Full Semantic Version Preservation (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Preserve full semantic versions (major.minor.patch) instead of stripping patch versions

**Independent Test**: Install a package with a specific patch version (e.g., @anthropic-ai/sdk@0.71.2), run the script, and verify CLAUDE.md shows "0.71.2" not "0.71".

### Implementation for User Story 4

- [x] T001 [US4] Update get_version() function in `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh` to preserve patch versions
- [x] T002 [US4] Update version extraction regex to capture major.minor.patch in `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh`
- [x] T003 [US4] Update perl substitution pattern to match major.minor.patch format in `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh`
- [x] T004 [US4] Preserve pre-release tags (e.g., -beta.2, -alpha.1) in version extraction in `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh`
- [x] T005 [US4] Test version extraction with various formats (^1.2.3, ~1.2.3, >=1.2.3, 1.2.3-beta.4) and verify full semver preserved

**Checkpoint**: At this point, full semantic versions should be preserved correctly in CLAUDE.md

---

## Phase 3: User Story 5 - Script Dependency Validation (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Provide clear error messages when required dependencies (jq, perl) are missing

**Independent Test**: Run the script on a system without jq installed and verify that a helpful error message is displayed with installation instructions.

### Implementation for User Story 5

- [x] T006 [P] [US5] Create check_dependency() function in `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh`
- [x] T007 [US5] Add dependency check for jq with installation instructions (brew/apt) in `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh`
- [x] T008 [US5] Add dependency check for perl with installation instructions in `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh`
- [x] T009 [P] [US5] Add version detection for jq (minimum 1.6) with warning for old versions in `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh`
- [x] T010 [P] [US5] Add version detection for perl (minimum 5.10) with warning for old versions in `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh`
- [x] T011 [US5] Update main() to call dependency checks before processing in `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh`
- [ ] T012 [US5] Test error messages by temporarily hiding jq/perl from PATH and verifying helpful output

**Checkpoint**: At this point, missing dependencies should produce clear, actionable error messages

---

## Phase 4: User Story 6 - Package List Documentation and Validation (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Add inline documentation for the package list and optional validation for unlisted packages

**Independent Test**: Add a new dependency to package.json, run the script with validation enabled, and verify that a warning is displayed if the package is not in the sync list.

### Implementation for User Story 6

- [x] T013 [P] [US6] Add inline comment block documenting tracked package list format in `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh`
- [x] T014 [P] [US6] Add inline instructions for adding new packages to sync list in `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh`
- [x] T015 [US6] Add --validate flag to script option parsing in `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh`

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 1 (US1-US3)**: ✅ Complete - PR 171 merged
- **Phase 2 (US4)**: Depends on Phase 1 completion (script exists) - Can start immediately
- **Phase 3 (US5)**: Depends on Phase 2 (US4) completion - Version extraction logic must be stable before adding validation
- **Phase 4 (US6)**: Depends on Phase 3 (US5) completion - Dependency validation should exist before package list validation
- **Phase 5 (US7)**: Depends on Phases 2-4 completion - Tests validate all script enhancements
- **Phase 6 (US8)**: Independent - Can start immediately (command infrastructure separate from scripts)
- **Phase 7 (US9)**: Depends on Phase 6 (US8) - Workflow mode applies to numbered aliases
- **Phase 8 (US10)**: Depends on Phase 7 (US9) - GitHub automation integrates with workflow mode
- **Phase 9 (US11)**: Independent - Can run in parallel with US8-US10
- **Phase 10 (US12)**: Depends on Phase 8 (US10) - PR creation requires issue number from auto-creation
- **Phase 11 (Polish)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

**Phase 2 Script Enhancements (Sequential)**:

- US4 (Full Semver) → US5 (Dependency Validation) → US6 (Package Validation) → US7 (Testing)
- Reason: Each builds on the previous enhancement to the script

**Phase 3 Workflow UX (Two Parallel Tracks)**:

Track 1 - Command Infrastructure (Sequential):

- US8 (Numbered Aliases) → US9 (Workflow Mode) → US10 (GitHub Issues) → US12 (PR Creation)

Track 2 - Visibility (Independent):

- US11 (Branch Visibility) - Can run in parallel with Track 1

**Independent Stories**:

- US8, US9, US10, US11, US12 are all independent of Phase 2 (script enhancements)
- US11 can be implemented independently of US8-US10, US12

### Within Each User Story

**Phase 2 (Script Enhancements)**:

- US4: Version extraction logic before regex updates before testing
- US5: Dependency check function before individual checks before testing
- US6: Documentation before validation logic before testing
- US7: Test infrastructure (mocks, fixtures) before test cases before execution

**Phase 3 (Workflow UX)**:

- US8: All symlinks can be created in parallel
- US9: User-guided prompts added to each command file (can be done in parallel)
- US10: Metadata extraction before issue generation before retry logic before testing
- US11: Branch detection before footer implementation before testing
- US12: Completion detection before PR generation before testing

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 2**:

- Within US5: T009 (jq version check) and T010 (perl version check) can run in parallel
- Within US6: T013 (documentation) and T014 (instructions) can run in parallel
- Within US7: All test case additions (T025-T034) can run in parallel after T024

**Phase 3**:

- All symlink creation tasks (T038-T047) in US8 can run in parallel
- US11 (Branch Visibility) can be implemented in parallel with US8-US10
- Within US10: Error handling tasks can be developed in parallel with main flow

**Phase 11**:

- T101-T105 (documentation updates) can all run in parallel
- T106 and T107 (PR creation) can run in parallel if on separate branches

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 7 (Testing)

```bash
# After T024 (test script framework) is complete, launch all test cases in parallel:
Task: T025 "Add test case: Valid package.json extraction"
Task: T026 "Add test case: npm prefix stripping"
Task: T027 "Add test case: Full semver preservation"

# Then sequentially:
Task: T035 "Make test script executable"
Task: T036 "Run complete test suite"
Task: T037 "Add to GitHub Actions"
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 8 (Numbered Aliases)

```bash
# All symlink creation tasks can run in parallel:
Task: T038 "Create symlink 1.constitution.md"
Task: T039 "Create symlink 2.specify.md"
Task: T040 "Create symlink 2.1.clarify.md"
Task: T041 "Create symlink 3.plan.md"

Task: T043 "Create symlink 4.tasks.md"
Task: T044 "Create symlink 5.implement.md"
Task: T045 "Create symlink 6.analyze.md"
Task: T046 "Create symlink 7.checklist.md"
Task: T047 "Create symlink 8.taskstoissues.md"

# Then sequentially:
Task: T048 "Test numbered alias invocation"
Task: T049 "Verify symlinks on all platforms"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 4-6 Only - Phase 2 Core)

1. ✅ Phase 1 already complete (US1-US3)
2. Complete Phase 2: US4 (Full Semver) - Core enhancement
3. Complete Phase 3: US5 (Dependency Validation) - Quality improvement
4. Complete Phase 4: US6 (Package Validation) - Maintenance improvement
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test script enhancements with real package updates
6. Optional: Add US7 (Testing) before moving to Phase 3

**MVP Delivers**: Enhanced script with full semver, dependency validation, and package documentation

### Incremental Delivery (Recommended)

**Phase 2 Delivery (Script Enhancements)**:

1. US4 → Test → Merge (Full semver preservation)
2. US5 → Test → Merge (Dependency validation)
3. US6 → Test → Merge (Package documentation)
4. US7 → Test → Merge (Automated testing)

**Phase 3 Delivery (Workflow UX)**:

1. US8 → Test → Merge (Numbered aliases)
2. US9 → Test → Merge (Workflow mode)
3. US10 → Test → Merge (GitHub issue creation)
4. US11 → Test → Merge (Branch visibility - can be done in parallel)
5. US12 → Test → Merge (PR creation)

Each story adds value independently without breaking previous functionality.

### Parallel Team Strategy

**If 2 developers available**:

After Phase 1 (already complete):

- Developer A: Phase 2 (US4-US7) - Script enhancements
- Developer B: Phase 3 Track 2 (US11) - Branch visibility

Once Developer A completes Phase 2:

- Developer A: Phase 3 Track 1 (US8→US9→US10→US12) - Command infrastructure
- Developer B: Continue with Phase 3 Track 2 (US11) or help with Track 1

Stories integrate independently at merge time.

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Phase 1 is already complete - focus on Phase 2 and Phase 3
- Phase 2 tasks are sequential (each builds on previous script enhancements)
- Phase 3 has two parallel tracks: command infrastructure (sequential) and visibility (independent)
- Commit after each task or logical group adhering to .claude/rules.md
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- GitHub automation (US10, US12) requires `gh` CLI authentication
- Symlinks (US8) must work across macOS, Linux, and WSL platforms
