## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 1** (GitHub Actions CI): No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Phase 2** (Docker): Can start in parallel with Phase 1
- **Phase 3** (VPS Setup): Can start in parallel with Phases 1-2
- **Phase 4** (Nginx & SSL): Depends on Phase 3 (VPS must exist)
- **Phase 5** (Deployment Automation): Depends on Phases 1, 2, 3, 4 (all infrastructure ready)
- **Phase 6** (Monitoring): Can start after Phase 5, or in parallel if monitoring setup is independent
- **Phase 7** (Documentation): Can start anytime, complete last

### Recommended Execution Order

**Sequential (single developer):**

1. Phase 1: GitHub Actions CI (automated testing foundation)
2. Phase 2: Docker Configuration (local testing of containers)
3. Phase 3: VPS Setup (provision and secure server)
4. Phase 4: Nginx & SSL (enable HTTPS access)
5. Phase 5: Deployment Automation (connect CI to production)
6. Phase 6: Monitoring (add observability)
7. Phase 7: Documentation (capture operational knowledge)

**Parallel (multiple developers or concurrent work):**

- Developer A: Phase 1 + Phase 2 (CI and Docker setup)
- Developer B: Phase 3 + Phase 4 (VPS and SSL setup)
- Developer C: Phase 7 (Documentation drafts)
- After Phases 1-4 complete:
  - Developer A: Phase 5 (Deployment integration)
  - Developer B: Phase 6 (Monitoring setup)

## Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1**:

- T001-T003 (GitHub Actions workflows can be created independently)
- T004 (Build caching is independent modification)

**Phase 2**:

- T010 (. dockerignore is independent)
- T011 (Health endpoint is independent)
- T012 (Entrypoint script is independent)

**Phase 3**:

- T019 (Setup script can be created in parallel with manual setup)

**Phase 4**:

- T020 (Nginx config can be created locally)
- T024 (SSL settings can be prepared in advance)

**Phase 5**:

- T026, T028, T029, T030 (All scripts can be created in parallel)

**Phase 6**:

- T032-T034, T036 (Logging, monitoring, and dashboard can be set up independently)

**Phase 7**:

- T037-T039 (All documentation can be written in parallel)
