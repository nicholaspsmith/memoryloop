# Pre-push hook for test validation and branch protection
# See specs/008-pre-commit-hooks for documentation
#
# Runs:
# 1. Unit tests (npm test -- --run)
#
# Note: Integration tests are run in CI, not pre-push, because they
# require external services (Ollama, PostgreSQL) that may not be available.
#
# Features:
# - Retry logic: retries failed tests once before blocking (FR-004a)
# - Flaky test warning: warns if tests pass on retry
# - Main branch protection: blocks direct pushes to main
#
# Bypass with: git push --no-verify
