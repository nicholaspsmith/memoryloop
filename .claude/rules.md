## General Guidelines

- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Write clear, imperative commit messages ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Subject line must be under 100 characters
- Reference issue/task numbers in commit body if needed, not subject line
- Detailed descriptions belong in commit body, not subject
