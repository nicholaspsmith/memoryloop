**Want to learn guitar? Master a new programming language? Finally understand quantum physics?** Loopi makes it happen.

Tell Loopi what you want to learn, and it generates a personalized skill tree—breaking down complex topics into bite-sized goals you can actually achieve. Then, using the science-backed FSRS spaced repetition algorithm, Loopi schedules your reviews at the perfect moment to cement knowledge into long-term memory.

No more forgotten tutorials. No more abandoned courses. Just steady, measurable progress toward mastering anything you set your mind to.

## Features

- **AI-Generated Skill Trees**: Tell Loopi what you want to learn and watch it create a structured learning path with clear milestones
- **Smart Goal Breakdown**: Complex topics get decomposed into achievable sub-goals so you always know your next step
- **FSRS Spaced Repetition**: Science-backed algorithm schedules reviews at optimal intervals for maximum retention
- **Interactive Study Sessions**: Chat with Claude to deepen understanding, then reinforce with flashcard reviews
- **Progress Visualization**: Track your mastery across skills with intuitive dashboards and statistics
- **Secure & Private**: Email verification, encrypted API keys, and comprehensive security logging

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16.0.10 with React 19 and App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.7
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js 5
- **Database**: Hybrid architecture
  - PostgreSQL (users, conversations, messages, API keys)
  - LanceDB (flashcards, review logs, vector embeddings)
- **AI**: Anthropic Claude API, Jina Embeddings API
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4
- **Testing**: Vitest, Playwright, React Testing Library

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed database design rationale.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or higher
- npm or yarn
- Anthropic API key ([get one here](https://console.anthropic.com/))

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nicholaspsmith/loopi.git
cd loopi
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# Authentication
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# PostgreSQL Database (Supabase or local)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/database

# LanceDB (local file-based)
DATABASE_PATH=./data/lancedb

# AI Services
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key
JINA_API_KEY=your-jina-api-key

# Email Configuration (SMTP)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.ethereal.email
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-ethereal-username
SMTP_PASS=your-ethereal-password
SMTP_FROM=noreply@loopi.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Generate a secure `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

**Email Setup for Development:**

For development, use [Ethereal Email](https://ethereal.email) - a fake SMTP service that captures emails without sending them:

1. Go to https://ethereal.email and click "Create Ethereal Account"
2. Copy the SMTP credentials to your `.env.local`
3. Password reset and verification emails will be captured at https://ethereal.email/messages

For production, configure a real SMTP provider (SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.).

**Note:** Users can optionally add their own Claude API key via the Settings page in the app (encrypted storage).

### 4. Initialize the database

```bash
npm run db:init
```

### 5. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Usage

### Getting Started

1. Create an account and verify your email
2. Add your Anthropic API key in Settings (or use the shared key if available)

### Setting Learning Goals

1. Go to the Goals dashboard
2. Click "New Goal" and describe what you want to learn
3. Loopi generates a skill tree with sub-goals and milestones
4. Start with any goal that interests you

### Study Sessions

1. Select a goal to study
2. Chat with Claude to explore the topic and deepen understanding
3. Loopi automatically generates flashcards from your conversations
4. Review flashcards when they're due—rate each as Again, Hard, Good, or Easy
5. The FSRS algorithm schedules optimal review times for long-term retention

### Tracking Progress

1. View your skill tree to see mastery levels across all goals
2. Check the dashboard for upcoming reviews and study streaks
3. Watch your knowledge compound over time

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests
npm test
